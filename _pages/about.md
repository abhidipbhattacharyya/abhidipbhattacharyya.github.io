I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/). I am pursuing Computer Science and Cognitive Science [dual degree](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/graduate-programs/cognitive-science-combined-phd). I am advised by [Prof. Martha Palmer](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/palmer-martha/) and [Prof. Christofer Heckman](http://www.ristoffer.ch/). I am part of [Computational Language and Education Research](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/). My research interests include Computer vision and Computational Linguistic with a focus on decoding semantics in Vision and Language. In my research I am exploring how language semantic can help in vision task.

Prior to my PhD I worked at TATA Resrach, Development and Design Center on extracting and formalizing bussiness rules from bussiness documents. I recieved my masters from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.

My research interests includes Machine Learning, Deep Neural Network, Computer Vision, Computational Linguistic.

I pursue [painting and drawing](/drawings/) and photography as my main hobbies.
