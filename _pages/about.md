I am a post-doc at [CICS at University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). My research interests include Computer vision and Computational Linguistics with a focus on decoding semantics in Vision and Language. In my research I am exploring how language semantic can help in vision task.

Before joining UMass, I earned my PhD in Computer science and Cognitive Science from [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/). I was advised by [Prof. Martha Palmer](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/palmer-martha/) and [Prof. Christofer Heckman](http://www.ristoffer.ch/). I was part of [CLEAR](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/).

Prior to my PhD I worked at TATA Resrach, Development and Design Center on extracting and formalizing bussiness rules from bussiness documents. I recieved my masters from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.

My research interests includes Machine Learning, Deep Neural Network, Computer Vision, Computational Linguistics.

I pursue [painting and drawing](/drawings/) and photography as my main hobbies.
