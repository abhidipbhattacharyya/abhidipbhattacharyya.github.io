I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/). I am pursuing Computer Science and Cognitive Science [dual degree](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/graduate-programs/cognitive-science-combined-phd). I am advised by [Prof. Martha Palmer](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/palmer-martha/) and [Prof. Christofer Heckman](http://www.ristoffer.ch/). I am affiliated to  [Computational Language and Education Research](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/). My research interests include Computer vision and Computational Linguistic with a focus on decoding semantics in Vision and Language.

Semantic decoding and Predicate-argument structure is a well researched problem in domain of Computational Linguistic. It has contributed to performance enhancement of many down-stream tasks. Image semantic is yet to enjoy similar success. However, with availability of large scale parallal data and advancement vision-language models cross-modal representation has achieved tremendous success, thereby bridging the gap between two modalities. In my research I am exploring how language semantics can enhance vision task.
